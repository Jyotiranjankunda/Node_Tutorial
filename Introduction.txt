Initially, JS was used in frontend only to enhance UI and interaction on website. (i.e, Button, dynamic color, popup).

But node js is : open source, server side js
It is a runtime that allow to run js code in the server.

Node js allows developer to use same language in frontend and backend, i.e, client side and server side.

Node js is built on top of chrome v8 js enginge, which is known for high performance and efficient execution of js code.

V8 engine -> open source Javascript engine -> developed by google -> to use in the google chrome web browser.

Human readable JS Code -> v8 converts to -> machine readable language

JS source code -> chrome v8 engine -> (parsing -> AST (Abstract syntax tree) -> Byte code -> machine code -> code runs on the cpu)

Clien side (request) <=> (response) server side
